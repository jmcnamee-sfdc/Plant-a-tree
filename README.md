# Plant A Tree!

This is a simple package that enables an org to reward staff who create an opportunity over a certain value (default 20k, configurable) by planting a tree in their name

## Cool - what next? 

By default, we use a development API for https://digitalhumani.com/ (RaaS - (Reforestation as a Service)) which will not plant any trees.

Set up your own corporate account, and configure the details via setup and you can then use this account to see details of tree requests planted. Each tree planted costs $1 at time of writing

## Extending this Demo
1: add an additional metadata field to act as a multiplier for trees planted per deal size eg: TreesPerThousand, where a value of 1 would mean 40 trees would be planted for a 40k deal etc
