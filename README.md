# Plant A Tree!

This is a simple package that enables an org to reward staff who create an opportunity over a certain value (default 20k, configurable) by planting a tree in their name

## Cool - what next? 

By default, we use a development API for https://digitalhumani.com/ (RaaS - (Reforestation as a Service)) which will not plant any trees.

Set up your own corporate account, and configure the details via setup and you can then use this account to see details of tree requests planted. Each tree planted costs $1 at time of writing
